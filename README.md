# LAB1_Kunitz_project
## Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain in protein sequences. The Kunitz domain is a small, structurally conserved domain found in a variety of proteins, with critical roles in protease inhibition and other biological processes.

Two HMMs were developed:
- One based on multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
- One based on structural alignment (3D)
  
Both models were trained using the HMMER suite and evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation. The structure-based model showed slightly superior performance.
