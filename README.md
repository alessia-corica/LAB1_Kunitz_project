# LAB1_Kunitz_project
## Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain in protein sequences (Pfam ID: PF00014). The Kunitz domain is a small, structurally conserved domain found in a variety of proteins, with critical roles in protease inhibition and other biological processes.\
The model is based on a structure-derived multiple alignment of representative domains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), aligned using PDBeFold and trained with HMMER.\
The HMM was evaluated on curated positive and negative datasets using 5-fold cross-validation, showing excellent predictive performance.

The work was carried out as part of the Laboratory of Bioinformatics 1 course during the MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Bologna.
